### mysql query

mysql group by count query seems to be faster and returned 435k rows in QA and PROD.

```sql
select rich_term_id, count(*) from contentitem_rich_term where content_site_id = 166379925144610478 group by 1 limit 500000;
```
Took less than 8 seconds. Exported via mysql workbench - final csv file **9.1 MB**
