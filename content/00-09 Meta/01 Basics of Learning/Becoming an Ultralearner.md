1. **Metalearning: First draw a map**: The first step is rather untraditional. Before starting to learn, you’ll have to spend some time, as described by the author, “learning how to learn the subject.” This means researching the topic and creating your own curriculum that will assist you along your journey.

2. **Focus: Sharpen your knife**: Concentration. That’s the secret ingredient to master skills in months, even in days, rather than in years. Your ability to focus on a single task will greatly increase your progress.

3. **Directness: Go straight ahead**: This step is about doing what you want to learn even before you understand the fundamentals. Or as illustrated by the author, “The easiest way to learn directly is to simply spend a lot of time doing the thing you want to become good at.”

4. **Drill: Attack your weakest point**: To become world-class, you need to fortify the weak links on your bag of tricks. Break down the hard, complex tasks you currently suck at. Then, practice till you’re better.

5. **Retrieval: Test to learn**: Studies performed by psychologists prove that trying to recall information without looking at the text is the best way to retain information for a long period of time. Even if you’re not ready, test your skill without looking at your notes.

6. **Feedback: Don’t dodge the punches**: Look forward to negative feedback. Expect it. Ask for it. Don’t cling on the nice words said by your parents. Seek criticism from outside people who don’t know you. Paying attention to comments that are unfavorable will uncover the path forward you were unable to see for yourself.

7. **Retention**: **Don’t fill a leaky bucket**: It sounds bizarre, but learning is the easy part. Remembering what you’ve learned is where things get a little tricky. Repeating the fundamentals after some time should be included in your curriculum.

8. **Intuition**: **Dig deep before building up**: Understand how things work, deeply. There is a difference between knowing the name of something and actually knowing something. Ask questions and imagine situations in your mind that fit your own understanding when others explain complex problems.
   
9. **Experimentation: Explore outside your comfort zone**: Self-educating yourself in one field won’t be enough to become widely popular in a specific area. You need to try many techniques. To experiment with materials and methods. By doing so, you’ll start to see solutions where others see only problems.**
