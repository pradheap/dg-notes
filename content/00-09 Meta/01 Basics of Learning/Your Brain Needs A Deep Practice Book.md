#### **Your brain needs real challenges**
1. Don't waste your time with problems that are easy for you
#### **Your brain needs to know what it doesn't know**
1. You want to steer toward confusion and frustration — but you don't want to stay there!
2. Systematically identify what it is, precisely, that you don't know. Do this consciously; in fact, write it down.
#### **Your brain needs questions**
1. When you isolate something you don't understand, pose it as a question
#### **Your brain needs immediate correction**
1. So “cheat”: look at the answer explanations! When you're practicing, get immediate feedback.
2. Ever wonder how some people become really good at math? It's not because they're thinking more. On the contrary: they're thinking less.
3. People who are good at math have built the discoveries they’ve made before into their long-term memories. While the rest of us are re-constructing concepts each time we solve a problem, they’re casually borrowing from their long-term store of memories.
4. Storing information in your long-term memory will allow you to think less in the moment. It'll save your brain from needing to re-create everything again and again.
5. And to store this information, you need a system. It's terrifying, but you forget most of what you learn. In fact, you forget it quickly!
#### **Your brain needs the basics to be automated**
1. Your attention can only hold onto a few things at once, and it takes some attention to pull information out of your long-term memory.
2. The information you recall a lot has been "automated" — made into a reflex
#### **Your brain needs** _**multiple**_ **methods to understand a problem deeply**
1. Genius comes when you understand the deep structure of a math problem — what it looks like on its most fundamental level, beyond its superficial features.
2. There is a method that helps: find multiple ways to solve a problem.
3. By understanding multiple methods, your brain will be able to see the deep structure of the problem.

3. Learn to _teach_ the problems
4. Ask for help
5. Re-solve the problems regularly
