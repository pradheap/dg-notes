**Making badass developers - Fluent conference (Kathy Sierra)**

Cognitive resource management
A - Can’t do (but need to)
B - Can do with effort
C - Mastered (reliable / automatic)
  

**Problem 1**: Pile up on B
Too many things to learn/concentrate.
Cognitive resource is drained.

**Prob 2**: Can’t seem to get better, half-assed skills

**Prob 3**: Takes too long or slow progress

How to fix the above three problems:

**Solution 1**:  Fixing the pile up on B
1. Keep more on A
2. Split B into subskills and move them into C
3. Take a skill rom A to C within:
	1. Max 3 sessions (45 - 90 mins)
**Reduce time spent practice being mediocre.**

**Solution 2**: Revisit skills on C
1. What’s on your C?
2. Coding style / Prog. paradigm
3. What you know / What you do?

**Solution 3**:  Sloooow to C
1. Challenges to learning new skills
2. Bypass B?

Key take-away message: When learning something new, expose your brain to hundreds of high-quality samples of (whatever you're trying to learn) in a short period of time, and the brain will learn to automatically recognize patterns. The skill will become automatic.
