Some points from https://www.recurse.com/manual
- Don't worry about choosing the "perfect" project. It's easy to let the perfect be the enemy of the good when it comes to project selection.
- 
- Develop a good mental model of your code.

- Write small programs from scratch.

- Give yourself progressively larger challenges. For example, write a project you think will take an hour, then an afternoon, then a day, then two daysâ€¦

- Don't let yourself get comfortable.

- Be rigorous. Understand how and why your code works. Understand your tools. If you're working with a framework (like Sinatra or Flask), learning to use it is just scratching the surface. Go deeper. Learn how it works.

- Strive for greatness. You're all at the Recurse Center because we believe you can be great programmers. Becoming great requires a lot of work, so make sure you're putting work in. Focus, be ambitious, don't get complacent. Becoming great takes a lifetime, and there's always more to learn.

- Reflect on your progress. We're all getting better at programming, but we should also be getting better at learning. Reflecting looks different for different people, but we recommend two primary things. First, write a blog! Even if no one else reads it, writing prose is a great way to crystallize concepts in your mind and deepen your understanding. Second, get code review! It's so much easier to get better when you're getting feedback and advice.
