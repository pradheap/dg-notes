## You can choose your life.

### Locust of Control. - Internal vs External.

Internal: You believe that you control your life.
External: You believe that external forces control your life.

Can you choose what happens to you? You get good and bad cards through the life. Do you dwell on the bad cards? Sometimes they are good and bad, big and small cards.

Can you make use of the good cards when you get them? Or do you let the bad cards push you over?
You always have the option to react or not for others' actions. You can let the negative feelings to go. Do not dwell on the negative emotions and make them flourish. You should always win regardless of the cards that are dealt for you.

**You can choose and don't let others choose it for you. You can take control of every situation and set a positive vibe in every situation.**

### You are your job
Think about yourself as self-employed.  You are just "You Limited". You are hiring out your time to your organization. This is the starting point for your self motivation. Every day, earn your place, improve your work, develop yourself. Get better and better on what you do. 

### You can't go to work just for money
Given your job is majority of your life, do something that you love or find a way to love your current job or as well do both.

### Work is work and it doesn't matter

It's no more hard work to do a good job at work than doing a mediocre job. If you don't care about the job, it wears you out and it doesn't interest you anymore.
Your work affects the company and customers.
### They don't pay me enough to care

Care anyway, regardless of the money. You should care about job because of yourself. 
Imagine your are a manager, who will you promote?
1. Someone who cares
2. Someone who do not care but can care if the pay is increased.
So if you put in the effort, the money will follow.
### Overcoming Peer Pressure
If you look at your colleagues who pressure you to do a half-hearted job, where has it got them?

## The Do Get Feel Circle
What you do leads to what you get and it leads to what you feel and it again leads to what you do? 
**Do -> Get -> Feel -> Do**
If you in a bad circle or an unhappy circle, you can choose to change your behavior. But you could also change your beliefs, you can change how you feel?
So these two will change 'Do' and 'Feel' and will change what you 'GET'.
Good circles are only possible when you do a good job and have a good boss.
### How the circle can go bad (and then stay bad)?
1. Bad start with the boss.
2. Boss starts it. (Boss don't inspire you, ignore you etc., )
3. No one started the problem. (Bad communication, bad atmosphere, bad personality etc.,)
### How do we break out of the bad circle?
It's so easy to get into it. But hard to get out. Once you recognize the issue, it's easy to get out.
1. Try doing a brilliant job, or improve the job. It'll take some time to payoff.
2. It may never change, if the situation is permanently broken.

### 4. Learning
How long could you do a job without learning? Always lookout for new things to learn? Ask what new things can you learn today on the job or outside the job. When you learn new things, you can achieve more and enjoy more and become more motivated. **Invest in your brain.**
### 5. Self Talk
What you say to yourself in your mind? This is just changing the 'Feel' part of the circle, so if you can change it, then you can also change the Do part and change the GET part ultimately.
How can we change our thoughts and beliefs which can lead to better outcomes?
Beliefs controls our thoughts and thoughts control our behavior.
Bad beliefs are built up over the years without you realizing.
1. 'I love my work' is a #1 mantra to say it to yourself.
2. 'I'm in control of my life'
3. 'I can choose my attitude'
4. 'I accept the things I can't change and don't waste time on it and only focus on the things I can change'
5. 'I deserve better than this'
6. 'It's not personal'
7. 'I can learn anything if I want to'
8. 'The answer's out there, I'm going to find it. I can find a way to fix it.'
By saying all these, you can start to change how you think and how to act.
### 6. Goals
Really important to know where you're going. goals make you disciplined and focused and are the roots of the motivation. 
1. Goals should make you feel uneasy. They should not be your routine things or responsibilities.
2. Goals should be positive which you can visualize.
3. Concrete goals, what goals actually look like. It should not be like job security.
4. Are you excited about these goals?
5. The goals should be measurable.
