 **Problem:**
 
**Inference** 
1. What did you understand?
2. Break down the problem with information available or provided. (This reduces the ambiguity nature and point down to what we have)
3. Write down your assumptions (If provided, not to deviate from the problem)
4. Write down the gaps between the dots (Based on the problem statement, extend the assumptions or raise appropriate questions focusing on the problem)
5. What to resolve? (This helps to focus what to solve not the unnecessary prejudices)
A:


**Solve**
1. What will be the general approach to solve it? (Write all possible approaches if available)
2. Where do I start or how do I start? Any brute force solution comes to mind.
3. Any known techniques from my past experience I could use?
4. If I use brute force, what do I need to optimize?
A:

**Pseudocode**
A:

**Code** and Big O


**Insights / Retrospection**
1. Any new insights? 
2. Were you stuck? How did you unblock yourself? What were the gaps?
3. Pitfalls/Gotchas etc.,
4. Solutions from Leet Code or other sources. Read them.
